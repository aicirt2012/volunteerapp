# Volunteer Application
Within the last year many foreigners arrived in the city of Munich. The coordination effort to organize events for this people is enormous.  Many volunteers are willing to offer different actions to support refugees in the daily life.  E.g. visiting the cinema or doctor. Our aim is to develop a Volunteer Application that helps to organize events for refugees. After the creation of events volunteers are informed and able to register for certain events.
